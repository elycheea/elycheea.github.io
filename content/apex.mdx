intro: "Defining the mission and brand of an IBM internal organization and building its first design system."
---

As a newly minted design team in the Market Development & Insights organization at IBM, one of our first assignments was to help redefine the organization’s **_mission statement_** and internal sub-brand within IBM. MD&I’s branding was several years old at the time and no longer aligned with the current IBM Design Language released in 2013.

Our goal was to define the MD&I mission statement and brand, and create the design system website, components, and assets to be used across internal communications, landing pages, and products and applications.

### The team
MD&I’s design team of 8, consisting of researchers, content writers, visual designes, and front-end developers

### Role
Co-develop the website for the design system and its initial components. Implement layout and structure and help define development styles and conventions.

### Skills & stack
HTML/CSS, vanilla Javascript, SCSS, Gulp, Nunjucks, npm, Express.js

<!-- # Goal
Define the MD&I brand mssion and develop the design system website and components to be used across internal communications, landing pages, tools, and intranets.

# tl;dr
We created the first design system for the internal Market Development & Insights organization, including the brand mission, voice, and tone. We built a component package maintained on Github and available through IBM’s internal npm registry. -->

# Process & experience
We interviewed our executive leadership team as well as a professionals working in the MD&I organization. Many of our interviewees expressed interest in a clear, comprehensive mission statement to work towards, but also in keeping it short enough to be memorable.

We wrote a few versions of the mission statement and brand principles, [playing back](https://www.ibm.com/design/thinking/page/framework/keys/playbacks) to the organization leaders to reach our final version. We chose color palettes that we felt would help communicate those concepts.

Once we established our colors, our team began exploring identifiers (logos) and creating the initial components of the design system. Without much existing context for our components, we based our initial components on common patterns that would feel familiar but branded in our own colors and styles.

# Outcome
The initial site for the MD&I design system, Apex, launched in January 2017, leveraging npm, Gulp, and Nunjucks as build tools, and Express routing. We defined our component styles in SASS, using BEM-like naming and additional utility classes.

The design system was well-received and with buy-in from the executive leadership team. Adoption was, however, slower through the 400-member organization. While we made presentation templates available, including colors and typography from the design system, this often meant re-work of existing presentations for many MD&Iers.

We continued to update the design system in approximately two-week iterations with new assets, such as email templates, updates to presentation templates, and branding resources.

In the coming months, we would identify a need to separate our basic components from the website itself. This would become the Apex components package.
